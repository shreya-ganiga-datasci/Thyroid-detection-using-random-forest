# Thyroid-detection-using-random-forest
Developed a machine learning model for thyroid disease detection using Random Forest. The dataset was preprocessed with missing value handling and categorical encoding, then split into training and testing sets. The model achieved high accuracy, with evaluation through confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importance analysis.
